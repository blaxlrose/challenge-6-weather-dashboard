# Challenge 06 - Weather Dashboard

## My Task

My goal was to use Third-party APIs to create a Weather Dashboard. This dashboard will retrieve weather data from searched cities and provide a five day forcast for that chosen city. The data is retrieved using the Open Weather Map API. All persistent data is saved in local storage. HTML and CSS on the page is updated dynamically using JavaScript.


## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
